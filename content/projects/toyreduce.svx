# ToyReduce

A tiny, hackable distributed MapReduce system written in Go that implements the core ideas from Google's MapReduce paper with aspects of Hadoop's architecture. It features automatic parallelization, fault-tolerant task scheduling, distributed intermediate storage, and peer-to-peer data transfer over plain HTTP.

Workers store intermediate data locally and shuffle via P2P, eliminating the centralized storage bottleneck. The system includes a real-time web UI for job monitoring and submission.

## Architecture

The system follows a Hadoop-like shuffle architecture with three types of nodes:

- **Master** (port 8080): Manages job queue, assigns tasks to workers, tracks completion, provides web UI
- **Workers** (ephemeral ports): Execute map/reduce tasks, store intermediate data in bbolt, serve partitions via HTTP
- **Store** (port 8081): Persists final job results only (not intermediate data)

Workers register with the master and provide their data endpoint. During the reduce phase, workers fetch partition data directly from other workers in parallel, creating a true peer-to-peer data transfer system.

## How It Works

1. **Map Phase**: Workers execute map tasks and store partitioned intermediate data in local bbolt storage
2. **Shuffle Phase**: Reduce workers fetch their assigned partition from all map workers in parallel via P2P HTTP requests
3. **Reduce Phase**: Workers execute reduce tasks and send final results to the central store for persistence

## Built-in Executors

ToyReduce comes with several built-in MapReduce executors:

- **wordcount** - Count word frequencies in text files
- **actioncount** - Count action types in log files (format: `user_123 did login`)
- **maxvalue** - Find maximum value per metric key (format: `cpu_usage:75.23`)
- **urldedup** - Deduplicate URLs (one unique URL per line)
- **average** - Calculate average value per metric key (format: `temperature:23.5`)

## Custom Executors

Creating custom executors is straightforward by implementing the `Worker` interface:

```go
type Worker interface {
    Map(chunk []string, emit Emitter) error
    Reduce(key string, values []string, emit Emitter) error
    Description() string
}
```

## Key Features

- **Distributed Processing**: Automatic parallelization across multiple workers
- **Fault Tolerance**: Task reassignment on worker failure
- **P2P Shuffle**: Workers communicate directly to transfer intermediate data
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Web UI for job submission and status tracking
- **Local Storage**: Each worker uses bbolt for efficient intermediate data storage
- **Hackable Design**: Simple codebase designed for learning and experimentation
- **HTTP-based**: All communication happens over plain HTTP, no complex protocols

## Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Store (final results)
toyreduce store

# Terminal 2: Master (coordinator + web UI at :8080)
toyreduce master --store-url http://localhost:8081

# Terminal 3+: Workers (compute + local storage)
toyreduce worker --master-url http://localhost:8080
toyreduce worker --master-url http://localhost:8080

# Submit job (via CLI or web UI)
toyreduce submit --executor wordcount --path /var/data/file --reduce-tasks 4
```

ToyReduce is built as an educational tool for understanding distributed systems concepts, making it perfect for learning how MapReduce works under the hood.
