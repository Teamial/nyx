# Foodle

Foodle | The Wordle for food. It's my own twist on the popular word-guessing game, specifically themed around food vocabulary.

Built using Svelte, SCSS, and TypeScript, this project was my first serious venture into web development. The site is managed using Cloudflare, GitHub Pages, and Google Analytics for performance monitoring.

What started as a learning project unexpectedly gained significant traction, receiving over 5,000,000 page visits. This success confirmed my interest in web development and encouraged me to pursue more projects in this field.
